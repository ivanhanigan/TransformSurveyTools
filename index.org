I'm reading Ritschard, G. (2006). Computing and using the deviance with classification trees. In Compstat 2006 - Proceedings in Computational Statistics 17th Symposium Held in Rome, Italy, 2006. Retrieved from http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-7908-1709-6_5

This is implemented in SPSS code. I'll try to develop R code to do these tests.
